# Geometric-Feature-Release

we provide a simple universal spatial modeling method perpendicular to the RNN model enhancement. Specifically, we select a set of simple geometric features, motivated by the evolution of previous work. With experiments on a 3-layer LSTM framework, we observe that the geometric relational features based on distances between joints and selected lines outperform other features and achieve state-of-art results on four datasets.
